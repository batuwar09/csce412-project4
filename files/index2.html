            I am very passionate about Computer Science, exploring the depths of
            artificial intelligence and machine learning. I believe that we
            can make a better and cleaner future through the use of machines
            and technology, which will be made possible by compassionate and
            caring people such as myself. This type of thinking is already
            spreading
            all over the globe and our
            <a

            </a>
            is already taking steps to educate and support studies and projects
            throughout the nation.
            I would like to become more experienced at coding and software
            development, not only at a sufficient level,
            but to the point of making things I thought was impossible,
            possible. I am working towards making my skills
            a muscle memory to utilize it not as a source of financial
            stability, but a tool to pursue my greater passion.

            I have recently read an
            <a

            </a>
            that I related to, and these type of future computer scientists are
            a great source of motivation because it
            reminds me that there are a lot of people like myself I will have
            the chance of working with. I would like to add
            that my cultural diversity and experience have also helped with
            exploring human motivation and success.
            over the course of the years, I have developed an advanced
            understanding of why people want the things they do
            as well as how can we make it a reality in the most efficient and
            clean way possible.
