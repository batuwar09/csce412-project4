            I have always been passionate about giving back to the community.
            <br>
            As a highschooler, I have donated and participated in
            various fundraising opportunities such as <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Harvey"
                target="blank">Hurrican Harvey</a> fundraising events.
            <br>
            I have participated in a <a
                href="https://www.unicefusa.org/startaclub" target="blank">UNICEF</a>
            club in highschool
            which I became the president of shortly after.
            <br>
            <br>
            I believe that volunteering and giving back to the community is an
            essential part of life which creates a
            <br>
            supportive environment where people can thrive. People who have
            struggled in the past can make way for upper comers
            <br>
            to follow and improve.
            <br>
            <br>
            I currently mentor highschool students and prospective international
            college students to support their passion and help
            <br>
            and help them pursue their college career.
            <br>
            <br>
            After completing my education, I believe that I will make a great
            impact on many people's lives.
