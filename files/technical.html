            As mentioned earlier, I have knowledge in most primary and essential
            areas of focus in computer science.
            <br>
            I have an inclination towards:
            <ul>
                <li>Data handling and management</li>
                <li>Program and software development</li>
                <li>Automation</li>
                <li>Data manipulation</li>
                <li>Automation testing</li>
            </ul>
            I am productive in a variety of environments, however, I am most
            successful in a team setting.
            <br>
            After years of experience working in team environments, I have come
            to appreciate
            efficiency, productivity, and support from fellow engineers.
            <br>
            My experiences in computer science helped me find out that I am very
            efficient in coding.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have been able to sharpen my skills by participating in
            challenging events such as
